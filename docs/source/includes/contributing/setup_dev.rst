Getting Started
===============

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up your development environment for CHORAS.
We always recommend creating a `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo/>`_ of the repository you would like to contribute to.
This allows you to freely develop and test your changes without affecting the main repository until you're ready to submit a pull request.

1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to (e.g., `choras-org/simulation-backend <https://github.com/choras-org/simulation-backend>`_). Please make sure that you enable giving maintainers access to your fork, so we can help you if you run into issues.
2. Clone your forked main repository to your local machine:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CHORAS
      cd CHORAS

   If you only want to contribute to the frontend/backend, you can instead clone the original repository.

3. Navigate into the CHORAS directory and initialize the three (``frontend-v2``, ``backend``, and ``simulation-backend``) submodules:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd CHORAS
      git submodule update --init --recursive

4. Update the remote URL of the submodules to point to your forked repositories. For example, for the simulation-backend submodule:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd simulation-backend
      git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-username>/simulation-backend

   If you prefer to use SSH instead of HTTPS, the command would be:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your-username>/simulation-backend.git

5. Optionally, you can also set up the upstream remote to keep your fork in sync with the original repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git remote add upstream https://github.com/choras-org/simulation-backend

6. Finally, create a new branch for your changes:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b my-feature-branch

7. Now you're ready to start developing. Follow the instructions on the next page to start implementing an interface for your simulation method.
